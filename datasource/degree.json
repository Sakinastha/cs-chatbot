      "description": "The undergraduate program in Computer Science at Morgan State University prepares students for careers in computing, graduate study in computer and data sciences, and for tackling the challenges they will face in both their professional and personal lives. The program focuses on equipping students with the knowledge and skills needed to produce solutions to complex problems. Students will learn how to clearly define problems, determine their tractability, evaluate alternatives, and design, implement, test, and document solutions. The program also emphasizes risk analysis, integrating alternative techniques and technologies, and effectively communicating solutions to a wide audience.",
