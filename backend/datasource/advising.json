It is a collaborative and interactive process where students work closely with their academic advisors to plan and navigate their educational path. To support you, weâ€™ve developed a roadmap that outlines the advising process. Please note that advising opens at different times throughout the semester, and class registration dates vary based on student classification (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). For the most up-to-date class registration timeline, refer to the link below.",
