        "introduction": "The faculty and staff of the Morgan State University Computer Science Department are dedicated to advancing the field of computer science, guided by our mission to provide high-quality education and foster innovation through cutting-edge research. Our faculty members bring expertise from a wide range of research areas and are committed to supporting students in their academic and professional growth. During the Academic Advising Period, the Computer Science faculty serve as academic advisors for students in the department, assisting with course planning, registration, and providing necessary academic guidance. Students can find their academic advisors in their respective offices, and office hours are posted on the board in the Computer Science Suite, Room 507. Based on students' last names, they can easily locate the right advisor for their needs.\n\nFor office hours related to anyone in the Department of Computer Science, it’s best to check the syllabus for your professor’s specific office hours if you’re enrolled in their course. If you’re not taking a course or need further assistance, feel free to email them directly to inquire about their office hours and schedule an appointment—especially if you’d like to discuss something important. Office hours can change frequently, so this is the most reliable way to stay updated.",
